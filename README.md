# Bloodhound Install Script
This is a PowerShell Script to Install Bloodhound and other necessary items. I found myself having to install this multiple times for multiple Active Directory environments, so I decided to script it instead. It will install the following:

1. Firefox
2. openjdk
3. neo4j
4. Bloodhound
5. Sharphound

If you don't need any of these components, just comment them out or remove them.
